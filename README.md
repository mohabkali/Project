# Project

An application or website designed to connect a network of chefs to the world and share their fantastic recipes.
In the application you should be able to create a chef account specifying your name and speciality, then should be able to upload your recipes.
Each recipe should be specified in terms of its category, cuisine, ingredients, method and name of the chef who uploaded the recipe. 
You can also access the recipes by a certain Chef or by a Cuisine you would like.
